* **Trauma arrivals** - patients with severe illness and trauma. They are

being discharged.
* **Non-trauma arrivals** - patients with minor illness and no trauma. They
go through registration and examination activities. A proportion of non-trauma
patients require treatment in a cubicle before being discharged.

You should:
1. Use the **sidebar** to change the model parameters.

3. Re-run the model with different parameters and **look at the effect** on
waiting times and utilisation of rooms."""

* The shaded yellow box shows the **95% confidence interval** of the mean

between the runs. These are coloured:
